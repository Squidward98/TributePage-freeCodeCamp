# Build a Tribute Page

## Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks

### User Stories:

- Your tribute page should have a _main_ element with a corresponding _id_ of **main**, which contains all other elements.
- You should see an element with an _id_ of **title**, which contains a string (i.e. text), that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").
- You should see either a _figure_ or a _div_ element with an _id_ of **img-div**.
- Within the _**#img-div**_ element, you should see an _img_ element with a corresponding _**id="image"**_.
- Within the _**#img-div**_ element, you should see an element with a corresponding _**id="img-caption"**_ that contains textual content describing the image shown in _**#img-div**_.
- You should see an element with a corresponding _**id="tribute-info"**_, which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
- You should see an a element with a corresponding _**id="tribute-link"_**, which links to an outside site, that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page.
- Your **#image** should use _max-width_ and _height_ properties to resize responsively, relative to the _width_ of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
- Your _img_ element should be centered within its parent element.
